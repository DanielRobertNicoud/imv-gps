# Intrinsic manifold GPs
Code for the paper "Intrinsic Gaussian Vector Fields on Manifolds" by Robert-Nicoud, Krause, and Borovitskiy.

**Note of the author:** The code extends `scikit-learn`'s GP implementation. It is a bit of a hack and it is a bit messy, but it works. A cleaner version will soon be available in the [https://github.com/GPflow/GeometricKernels/tree/main](GeometricKernels) package.

## Scripts present
1. `aux_functions.py`: Auxiliary functions used to treat ponts and vectors on the sphere.
2. `sphere_vector_kernel.py`:
3. `sphere_vector_gp.py`:
4. `blender_file_generation.py`:
5. `.ipynb`:
